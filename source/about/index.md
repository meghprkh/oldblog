Hello, I am Megh. I am a web developer who loves using ReactJS and other FRP concepts. In my free time I like to contribute to things that I use - especially GNOME.

I offer my web development services on freelance basis. You can hire me via [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/u/meghparikh.html)

I also love solving Math & Physics problems and playing puzzle/strategy games.

Currently I study Computer Science & Engineering at IIIT, Hyderabad.

You can contact me via my [site](https://meghprkh.github.io/) or my [github profile](https://github.com/meghprkh/)
