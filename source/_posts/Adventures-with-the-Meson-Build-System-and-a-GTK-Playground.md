This is a tutorial to create a simple hello world window using the [Meson build][1] system. The really nice thing about Meson is its *python-ish*/*lua-ish* syntax. The other thing is that it is *really* fast.

My experience
-------------

As a newbie I found Automake unfriendly (maybe because of its primitive m4 macro system). So I was looking for something quick to learn for building my [LibGamepad][2] library. Initially I opted for the awesome [Autovala][3]. But then I realized that while super-easy, it was not flexible. I wanted conditional compilation (per-platform) but could not do it. Then while I was looking at the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) files generated by Autovala, they too felt kind of cryptic, so I decided to start from scratch and write the CMake files on my own. Still even CMake's syntax was kind of weird and *macro-ish*. Then I tried a hand at Meson. Surprisingly I was able to easily build simple Vala programs without giving it much time.

The neat language
-----------------

In Meson, you feel like you are interacting with a higher-order language. You get immutable arrays and strings. Your interaction with the compiler modules is through objects. In short, *its just amazing*. I could have elaborated this section and written some features, but then you can find it on the [Meson Wiki](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki).

A GTK Playground / A starter kit
------------------------------------------
Ever want to prototype some mockup without fiddling with your main application? I created a small playground which I use for creating prototypes https://github.com/meghprkh/valagtk . You can simply open [Glade][5], create your prototype and add some interactivity using [GtkTemplate][4] in your Vala code and BOOM! This uses the Meson build system to give you an easy-to-extend starter along with super-fast builds.
