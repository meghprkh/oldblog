This means that you can play your favorite retro games using a gamepad!!!</p>

<h2 id="Which-gamepads-are-supported"><a href="#Which-gamepads-are-supported" class="headerlink" title="Which gamepads are supported?"></a>Which gamepads are supported?</h2><p>But you may wondering which gamepads are supported out of the box. The answer is a <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt" target="_blank" rel="external">lot of them</a>! We use the <a href="https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/release-2.0.4/include/SDL_gamecontroller.h#L96-L108" target="_blank" rel="external">SDL mappings format</a> to map your gamepad to a standard gamepad (by this I mean a seventh generation/XBox-360 kind of gamepad). And we use a huge community maintained <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt" target="_blank" rel="external">database</a> of mappings, so your device would most likely be there. We use a slightly modified version of this database. See <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/pull/94" target="_blank" rel="external">#94</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/pull/95" target="_blank" rel="external">#95</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-mappings"><a href="#Custom-mappings" class="headerlink" title="Custom mappings?"></a>Custom mappings?</h2><p>Well I just realized while writing this post that we had forgotten about this :sweat_smile:.  But I have made a <a href="https://github.com/Kekun/gnome-games/pull/310" target="_blank" rel="external">PR</a> for it, so it should get merged soon. But as of now there is no GUI for it. Currently you can use Steam or the SDL test/controllermap tool to generate a custom mapping string as described <a href="https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/release-2.0.4/src/joystick/SDL_gamecontrollerdb.h#L26-L30" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Then you should paste in in a file in the user’s config directory. As per this PR this file is <code>&lt;config_dir&gt;/gnome-games/gamecontrollerdb.txt</code> (<code>&lt;config_dir&gt;</code> is mostly <code>~/.config</code>).</p>
<h2 id="Multiplayer-support"><a href="#Multiplayer-support" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer support"></a>Multiplayer support</h2><p>Multiplayer games are quite well supported. As of now there is no GUI for reassigning gamepads to other players, but the default behaviour is quite predictable. Just plugin the gamepads in the order of the players and all will be well.</p>
<p>The exact behaviour is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first player with no gamepad will be assigned the keyboard</li>
<li>if there are <em>N</em> initially plugged-in gamepads, then they are assigned to the first <em>N</em> players and keyboard is assigned to player <em>N + 1</em></li>
<li>when a gamepad is plugged in, it is assigned to the first player with no gamepad (it may not be the last one), it can replace the keyboard</li>
<li>when a gamepad is plugged out, its player shouldn’t have any gamepad assigned but it shouldn’t change the player to which other gamepads are assigned</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Next-steps"><a href="#Next-steps" class="headerlink" title="Next steps"></a>Next steps</h2><p>The next steps involve adding a UI to remap the gamepads assigned too the players and then maybe a UI for remapping the controls if time permits.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

<p>Currently you can plugin a gamepad and it will just work! The app will automatically detect it and allow you to play your favorite game using the gamepad. Support for playing multiplayer games is also there.

<h2 id="How-its-being-done"><a href="#How-its-being-done" class="headerlink" title="How its being done"></a>How its being done</h2><p>To integrate gamepads a library was made. While currently this library is being developed as part of the GNOME Games codebase. Its developed under a different namespace. You can find the library code <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/libgamepad" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Please note that the API of this library is <em>unstable</em> and will keep changing.</p>
<p>This library is a small GLib-based library that is written in Vala and aims to be easy to use. While the long-term goal is to be cross-platform, currently it supports Linux only.</p>
<p>The gamepad mapping format used is compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB" target="_blank" rel="external">SDL mappings</a>. This means that you would be able to use many gamepads without requiring to configure them.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-there-in-the-future"><a href="#What’s-there-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="What’s there in the future?"></a>What’s there in the future?</h2><p>After some more cleanup, this code will hopefully be merged into the Games codebase. After that I will focus on adding UI for features like easy-assigning of gamepads to ports and remapping the gamepad.</p>
<p>I will keep posting updates on this blog. Stay tuned!</p>
