    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is meant to serve as a summary of work I did during GSoC. You may directly wish to skip to the <a href="#Links">links section</a></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="The-Goal"><a href="#The-Goal" class="headerlink" title="The Goal"></a>The Goal</h1><p>The goal to be achieved was to be able to play both single player and multiplayer emulated games using a gamepad in GNOME Games</p>
<h1 id="Where-are-we-right-now"><a href="#Where-are-we-right-now" class="headerlink" title="Where are we right now"></a>Where are we right now</h1><ul>
<li><em>Plug-n-play gamepad support:</em> We use the SDL mappings format and thus reuse a huge community DB of mappings to provide this.</li>
<li><em>Monitor plugin and unplugging of gamepads and react to it without user interaction:</em> The user should not be forced to take unnecessary steps to use the gamepads.</li>
<li><em>Multiplayer games/multiple gamepads support:</em> While there is no GUI for this the current way is intuitive and easy to use.  In fact, normally you won’t have the need to use the GUI at all. <a href="https://meghprkh.github.io/blog/2016/07/22/The-state-of-gamepad-support-in-Games/#Multiplayer-support">More about this here</a></li>
<li><em>Separate codebase that can be reused (not a library yet):</em> The codebase leaves under a separate directory and has no dependencies on the main codebase. In fact, initially it was developed under a different namespace. Also in the process a library - <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/libgamepad" target="_blank" rel="external">libgamepad</a> had been created. But I couldnt find the time to keep it up-to-date. Nevertheless it is functional currently also.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-is-left-to-be-done"><a href="#What-is-left-to-be-done" class="headerlink" title="What is left to be done"></a>What is left to be done</h1><ul>
<li>Intuitive GUI to remap gamepads when multiple gamepads are plugged in. Mockups had been created and discussed ad the final design is ready (more about this in a future blog post)! You can check the current progress <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/gnome-games/tree/dirty/feature/gamepad-select-ui-new" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Stretch-Goals"><a href="#Stretch-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Stretch Goals"></a>Stretch Goals</h1><p>I hope that I would be able to complete these during my winter vacation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a gamepad mapping creator UI (currently either Steam or SDL’s controller map tool can be used for this)</li>
<li>Update <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/libgamepad" target="_blank" rel="external">libgamepad</a> to match the current codebase of Games.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Challenges"><a href="#Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Challenges"></a>Challenges</h1><ul>
<li><em>Evdev and the Joystick API:</em> Initially WIP code had already been written by my mentor for the Joystick API and my project was to finish and polish that code. But later I came to know that the evdev API is the better API and that is what is used by all current libraries/programs (SDL/RetroArch). So I had to dig into the evdev API and start afresh.</li>
<li><em>VAPI for libevdev:</em> Vala requires us to create VAPIs for using C libraries (and you have to do it manually for non-Glib based ones). While creating the VAPI for libevdev I encountered a lot of challenges and got to know the Vala language much better.</li>
<li><em>Understanding the SDL codebase and the mappings format:</em> Now we needed a good mappings database. So we thought that it would be better if we could reuse some already existing database. So we decided to adopt the SDL mappings format, but I had some difficulty initially understanding their format (especially the GUID). Also I took inspiration from the SDL code and adopted it but I faced some difficulty understanding their C code.</li>
<li><em>Multiplayer support:</em> We needed an intuitive way which does not interfere with the user, i.e. we wanted a way to implement this so that the user will not have to do anything to play multiplayer games by default but if he wants he can configure the default assignment. After some brainstorming we decided on <a href="https://meghprkh.github.io/blog/2016/07/22/The-state-of-gamepad-support-in-Games/#Multiplayer-support">this</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Some-technical-details"><a href="#Some-technical-details" class="headerlink" title="Some technical details"></a>Some technical details</h1><ul>
<li><a href="https://meghprkh.github.io/blog/2016/06/03/Handling-joysticks-and-gamepads-in-linux/">Evdev</a> was used using <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest/" target="_blank" rel="external">libevdev</a> to handle gamepads</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev" target="_blank" rel="external">Udev</a> was used using <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/libgudev" target="_blank" rel="external">GUdev</a> for detecting plugging/unplugging of gamepads</li>

    <updated>2016-07-21T20:16:39.244Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gamepad support has now been merged into <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Playground/Games" target="_blank" rel="external">GNOME Games</a> <a href="https://github.com/Kekun/gnome-games/commit/c110c0390f40821779f2663bde50027b1f9f1acd" target="_blank" rel="external">v3.21.4</a> !!! This means that you can play your favorite retro games using a gamepad!!!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Which-gamepads-are-supported"><a href="#Which-gamepads-are-supported" class="headerlink" title="Which gamepads are supported?"></a>Which gamepads are supported?</h2><p>But you may wondering which gamepads are supported out of the box. The answer is a <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt" target="_blank" rel="external">lot of them</a>! We use the <a href="https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/release-2.0.4/include/SDL_gamecontroller.h#L96-L108" target="_blank" rel="external">SDL mappings format</a> to map your gamepad to a standard gamepad (by this I mean a seventh generation/XBox-360 kind of gamepad). And we use a huge community maintained <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt" target="_blank" rel="external">database</a> of mappings, so your device would most likely be there. We use a slightly modified version of this database. See <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/pull/94" target="_blank" rel="external">#94</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/pull/95" target="_blank" rel="external">#95</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-mappings"><a href="#Custom-mappings" class="headerlink" title="Custom mappings?"></a>Custom mappings?</h2><p>Well I just realized while writing this post that we had forgotten about this :sweat_smile:.  But I have made a <a href="https://github.com/Kekun/gnome-games/pull/310" target="_blank" rel="external">PR</a> for it, so it should get merged soon. But as of now there is no GUI for it. Currently you can use Steam or the SDL test/controllermap tool to generate a custom mapping string as described <a href="https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/release-2.0.4/src/joystick/SDL_gamecontrollerdb.h#L26-L30" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Then you should paste in in a file in the user’s config directory. As per this PR this file is <code>&lt;config_dir&gt;/gnome-games/gamecontrollerdb.txt</code> (<code>&lt;config_dir&gt;</code> is mostly <code>~/.config</code>).</p>
<h2 id="Multiplayer-support"><a href="#Multiplayer-support" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer support"></a>Multiplayer support</h2><p>Multiplayer games are quite well supported. As of now there is no GUI for reassigning gamepads to other players, but the default behaviour is quite predictable. Just plugin the gamepads in the order of the players and all will be well.</p>
<p>The exact behaviour is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first player with no gamepad will be assigned the keyboard</li>
<li>if there are <em>N</em> initially plugged-in gamepads, then they are assigned to the first <em>N</em> players and keyboard is assigned to player <em>N + 1</em></li>
<li>when a gamepad is plugged in, it is assigned to the first player with no gamepad (it may not be the last one), it can replace the keyboard</li>
<li>when a gamepad is plugged out, its player shouldn’t have any gamepad assigned but it shouldn’t change the player to which other gamepads are assigned</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Next-steps"><a href="#Next-steps" class="headerlink" title="Next steps"></a>Next steps</h2><p>The next steps involve adding a UI to remap the gamepads assigned too the players and then maybe a UI for remapping the controls if time permits.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes some of my experience with the <a href="http://mesonbuild.com/" title="Meson Build" target="_blank" rel="external">Meson Build</a> system. Also I have created a playground for GTK which I use to create simple protoypes with some functionality. The really nice thing about Meson is its <em>python-ish</em>/<em>lua-ish</em> syntax. The other thing is that it is <em>really</em> fast.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="My-experience"><a href="#My-experience" class="headerlink" title="My experience"></a>My experience</h2><p>As a newbie I found Automake unfriendly (maybe because of its primitive m4 macro system). So I was looking for something quick to learn for building my <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/libgamepad" title="LibGamepad" target="_blank" rel="external">LibGamepad</a> library. Initially I opted for the awesome <a href="https://github.com/rastersoft/autovala" target="_blank" rel="external">Autovala</a>. But then I realized that while super-easy, it was not flexible. I wanted conditional compilation (per-platform) but could not do it. Then while I was looking at the <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">CMake</a> files generated by Autovala, they too felt kind of cryptic, so I decided to start from scratch and write the CMake files on my own. Still even CMake’s syntax was kind of weird and <em>macro-ish</em>. Then I tried a hand at Meson. Surprisingly I was able to easily build simple Vala programs without giving it much time.</p>
<h2 id="The-neat-language"><a href="#The-neat-language" class="headerlink" title="The neat language"></a>The neat language</h2><p>In Meson, you feel like you are interacting with a higher-order language. You get immutable arrays and strings. Your interaction with the compiler modules is through objects. In short, <em>its just amazing</em>. I could have elaborated this section and written some features, but then you can find it on the <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki" target="_blank" rel="external">Meson Wiki</a>.</p>

I created a small playground which I use for creating prototypes <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/valagtk" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/meghprkh/valagtk</a> . You can simply open <a href="https://glade.gnome.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Glade</a>, create your prototype and add some interactivity using <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tvb/2013/05/29/composite-templates-lands-in-vala/" target="_blank" rel="external">GtkTemplate</a> in your Vala code and BOOM! This uses the Meson build system to give you an easy-to-extend starter along with super-fast builds.</p>

<h2 id="How-its-being-done"><a href="#How-its-being-done" class="headerlink" title="How its being done"></a>How its being done</h2><p>To integrate gamepads a library was made. While currently this library is being developed as part of the GNOME Games codebase. Its developed under a different namespace. You can find the library code <a href="https://github.com/meghprkh/libgamepad" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Please note that the API of this library is <em>unstable</em> and will keep changing.</p>
<p>This library is a small GLib-based library that is written in Vala and aims to be easy to use. While the long-term goal is to be cross-platform, currently it supports Linux only.</p>
<p>The gamepad mapping format used is compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB" target="_blank" rel="external">SDL mappings</a>. This means that you would be able to use many gamepads without requiring to configure them.</p>

    <title>Handling joysticks and gamepads in linux</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I would share some of the things I came across when dealing with<br>the handling of joysticks and gamepads in Linux. One of the goals I wanted to<br>achieve was to make our controller mappings compatible with the SDL ones so that<br>we can reuse the community maintained controller mapping database that they have.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The full code can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/meghprkh/9cdce0cd4e0f41ce93413b250a207a55" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing that I want to clarify is that Linux provides <em>two</em> APIs for<br>dealing with joysticks. One is the legacy <em>joystick</em> API and the other is the<br>modern <em>evdev</em> API. The evdev-based API provides more detailed information about<br>the buttons and axes available and SDL2 only supports the evdev API so we<br>decided to go with the evdev API.</p>
<p>Quoting Arch Wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/dev/input/jsX</code> maps to the ‘Joystick’ API interface and <code>/dev/input/event*</code><br>maps to the ‘evdev’ ones (this also includes other input devices such as mice<br>and keyboards). Symbolic links to those devices are also available in<br><code>/dev/input/by-id/</code> and <code>/dev/input/by-path/</code> where the legacy ‘Joystick’ API<br>has names ending with -joystick while the ‘evdev’ have names ending with<br><code>-event-joystick</code>.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For using the evdev API, I decided to use the libevdev library instead of using traditional <code>ioctl</code> calls as this library provided simpler higher-level access to the evdev API.</p>
<p>Moving on to our main goal: we want to reuse the SDL mappings. The SDL mappings look something like these:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">&quot;guid,name,mappings&quot;</div><div class="line">&quot;030000006d0400001dc2000014400000,Logitech F310 Gamepad (XInput),a:b0,b:b1,back:b6,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b8,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b9,lefttrigger:a2,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b10,righttrigger:a5,rightx:a3,righty:a4,start:b7,x:b2,y:b3,&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Quoting SDL documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mapping format for joystick is:<br>    bX - a joystick button, index X<br>    hX.Y - hat X with value Y<br>    aX - axis X of the joystick<br>Buttons can be used as a controller axis and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post we will assume that we will handle the parsing of this mapping and only need to get the indexes correctly (like <code>b0</code>, <code>a2</code>, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="Generating-GUID"><a href="#Generating-GUID" class="headerlink" title="Generating GUID"></a>Generating GUID</h2><p>So the first problem was to decipher how the GUID was generated. The GUID is an 128-bit code that is time and device independent. Its constructed using the bustype, vendor, product and version of the device. It is generated using the following code:</p>
<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">get_guid</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">struct</span> libevdev * dev, guint16 * guid)</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">0</span>] = GINT16_TO_LE(libevdev_get_id_bustype(dev));</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">1</span>] = <span class="number">0</span>;</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">2</span>] = GINT16_TO_LE(libevdev_get_id_vendor(dev));</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">3</span>] = <span class="number">0</span>;</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">4</span>] = GINT16_TO_LE(libevdev_get_id_product(dev));</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">5</span>] = <span class="number">0</span>;</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">6</span>] = GINT16_TO_LE(libevdev_get_id_version(dev));</div><div class="line">    guid[<span class="number">7</span>] = <span class="number">0</span>;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>As we want it to be device independent, we use the <code>GINT16_TO_LE</code> helper from glib to convert a 16 bit number to little endian.</p>
<p>But to convert this to string we convert it to its hexadecimal equivalent using the following simple code:</p>
<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">guid_to_string</span><span class="params">(guint16 * guid, <span class="keyword">char</span> * guidstr)</span> </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">char</span> k_rgchHexToASCII[] = <span class="string">"0123456789abcdef"</span>;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">int</span> i;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> (i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="number">8</span>; i++) &#123;</div><div class="line">        <span class="keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="keyword">char</span> c = guid[i];</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">        *guidstr++ = k_rgchHexToASCII[c &gt;&gt; <span class="number">4</span>];</div><div class="line">        *guidstr++ = k_rgchHexToASCII[c &amp; <span class="number">0x0F</span>];</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">        c = guid[i] &gt;&gt; <span class="number">8</span>;</div><div class="line">        *guidstr++ = k_rgchHexToASCII[c &gt;&gt; <span class="number">4</span>];</div><div class="line">        *guidstr++ = k_rgchHexToASCII[c &amp; <span class="number">0x0F</span>];</div><div class="line">    &#125;</div><div class="line">    *guidstr = <span class="string">'\0'</span>;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Feature-Detection-and-mapping-to-the-SDL-indexes"><a href="#Feature-Detection-and-mapping-to-the-SDL-indexes" class="headerlink" title="Feature Detection and mapping to the SDL indexes"></a>Feature Detection and mapping to the SDL indexes</h2><p>Now coming to the feature detection part. We use the helper <code>libevdev_has_event_code (dev, type, code)</code> to detect if the device has a button/axis/hat. This way we loop over the possible values of the code for each type (<code>EV_KEY</code> for button, <code>EV_ABS</code> for axes and hat) and map it to an increasing number. That is the first valid axis code we found is <code>axis0</code> or <code>a0</code>, the second valid axis is <code>a1</code> and so on. It is the same for buttons.</p>
<p>For example, following is part of the code for buttons:<br><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">int</span> nbuttons = <span class="number">0</span>;</div><div class="line">guint8 key_map[KEY_MAX];</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (i = BTN_JOYSTICK; i &lt; KEY_MAX; ++i) &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, i)) &#123;</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">printf</span>(<span class="string">"%d - Joystick has button: 0x%x - %s\n"</span>, nbuttons, i,</div><div class="line">                libevdev_event_code_get_name(EV_KEY, i));</div><div class="line">        key_map[i - BTN_MISC] = nbuttons;</div><div class="line">        ++nbuttons;</div><div class="line">    &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>And while polling we find the button number through this <code>key_map</code>:<br><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="built_in">printf</span>(<span class="string">"Button %d\n"</span>, key_map[ev.code - BTN_MISC]);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>We do similar stuff for axes and hats even though the way we map changes. The hats mapping like <code>h0.4</code> can be done using a simple map from code and value. But SDL returns output as a 8-way dpad giving one of the eight values (like up, leftup, etc.) while evdev gives hat as two axes and reports two events: left and up on pressing the dpad/hat in the leftup direction.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>For polling events we use the <code>libevdev_next_event</code> function. The full <strong>libevdev documentation</strong> can be found <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<p>The <strong>full code</strong> can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/meghprkh/9cdce0cd4e0f41ce93413b250a207a55" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. While this code uses glib, it only uses simple helper functions from glib which can be easily reimplemented. The only complex glib functions used are to detect the event-joystick device from the <code>/dev/input/by-path</code> folder. This code also doesnot have several fallbacks that the SDL code has.</p>
<p>My future work will involve the integration of this ‘playground’ code into the main GNOME Games code and also parsing the mapping. Other things that need to be done is to handle hats properly, handle fallbacks and see if we want to detect joystick devices by polling only or use udev.</p>

      &lt;p&gt;In this post I would share some of the things I came across when dealing with&lt;br&gt;the handling of joysticks and gamepads in Linux. One of the goals I wanted to&lt;br&gt;achieve was to make our controller mappings compatible with the SDL ones so that&lt;br&gt;we can reuse the community maintained controller mapping database that they have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I am participating in Google Summer Of Code 2016 under the GNOME project.</p>
<p>My project is related to an application called <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games/" target="_blank" rel="external">GNOME Games</a>. As you can see this app serves as an catalog of games alongside an emulator. My proposal is related to adding support for gamepads/joysticks/controllers to this app. By this I mean the ability to play emulated games using the gamepad.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>This proposal has plans for adding support for remappabale controls and multiple gamepads (for multi-player games). This would come with an easy to use UI.</p>
<p>Also other stretch goals include the ability to control the “Games UI” itself using the gamepad as well as making the code reusable so that it can be used as a library. Some other stretch goals involve moving the gamepad configuration UI to control center as well as having gamepad support for the GNOME games pack itself (will start with Nibbles).</p>
<p>Looking forward to having a great summer wherein I will put my full potential into developing this ideas with the aid of my mentor <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/AdrienPlazas" target="_blank" rel="external">Adrien Plazas</a>. I will regularly post updates here.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-10T18:25:27.659Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am participating in Google Code In 2014 and two of my tasks were based on RPM packaging for Fedora.<br><a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2014/5262603731337216" target="_blank" rel="external">The first</a> was packaging <a href="http://www.phalconphp.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">PhalconPHP</a> for Fedora while <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2014/5774064475963392" target="_blank" rel="external">the second</a> was packaging <a href="http://cakephp.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">CakePHP</a>.<br>Phalcon is an C extension while Cake is a PEAR/Composer extension.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>I will discuss the easier of the two, Cake as it was a PEAR package.</p>
<p>So first of all, you need to learn some RPM Packaging Basics. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package" target="_blank" rel="external">This link</a> briefly introduces us to the necessary tools and their setup. But the above link does not introduce us to <a href="http://copr.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Copr</a> which may be used to distribute and even build our RPMS on different platforms (we can use it as a sort of substitute for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package#Mock_and_Koji" target="_blank" rel="external">Koji or Mock</a>).</p>
<p>Then I recommend that you read <a href="[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging">PHP Packaging wiki</a>:</p>
<h2 id="The-Channel-package"><a href="#The-Channel-package" class="headerlink" title="The Channel package"></a>The Channel package</h2><p>So lets say we have identified the PEAR channel (pear.example.org) and it is not the standard PEAR channel. So we need to create a CHANNEL package.</p>
<p>So lets create the SPEC file :<br><script src="//gist.github.com/meghprkh/066d9477881f168c77b4.js"></script></p>
<p>As you can see you just need to edit a few lines (lines 2,3) to update the channel name and URL and the last lines for proper changelogs.</p>
<p>Now you can build this spec using the <code>rpmbuild</code> command.</p>
<p>Install the generated RPM on your system (provided the build is successful).</p>
<h2 id="The-PEAR-Package"><a href="#The-PEAR-Package" class="headerlink" title="The PEAR Package"></a>The PEAR Package</h2><p>Now lets head on to creating the actual SPEC file of the RPM package.</p>
<ul>
<li>First install the <code>php-pear-PEAR-Command-Packaging</code> package.</li>
<li>Download the PEAR package from the channel (mostly <em><a href="http://channelname/get/name-version.tgz" target="_blank" rel="external">http://channelname/get/name-version.tgz</a></em>)</li>
<li>Run <code>pear make-rpm-spec Foo.tgz</code> .</li>
<li>and a spec file will be generated for you (with all required files) …</li>
<li>… but if it is not from the standard PEAR channel, you will need to add the channel to the requires and modify certain lines …</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/meghprkh/39fa65e683f36a4b3996" target="_blank" rel="external">my spec for CakePHP</a></li>
<li>Done now You just need to build it …</li>
<li>If the build fails make sure you had installed the Channel Package</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">%global pear_name example</div><div class="line">%global pear_channel pear.example.org</div><div class="line">URL:            http://%&#123;pear_channel&#125;/package/%&#123;pear_name&#125;</div><div class="line">Source0:        http://%&#123;pear_channel&#125;/get/%&#123;pear_name&#125;-%&#123;version&#125;.tgz</div><div class="line">BuildRequires:  php-channel(%&#123;pear_channel&#125;)</div><div class="line">Requires:       php-channel(%&#123;pear_channel&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="The-Copr-Build-System"><a href="#The-Copr-Build-System" class="headerlink" title="The Copr Build System"></a>The Copr Build System</h2><p>Lets say you have Fedora 20 on your system but you also want to build it for other Fedora and EPEL versions and also make the installation simpler for the end user. So the right tool you need to use is the <a href="http://copr.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Copr</a> Build System.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload your SRPMs to some file sharing service which permits direct downloads through a link (I used GitHub but thats a bad habit for git is extremely slow with binary files (SRPMS are gzipped files)).</li>
<li>Go to the Copr build system page.</li>
<li>Read their wiki a little.</li>
<li>Login and create a new repo</li>
<li>First build the Channel package in your repo</li>
<li>Drink some coffee. Its gonna take some time.</li>
<li>Next build the PEAR package (build it after the first completes for it is dependent onthe channel package)</li>
<li>Share your work.</li>
<li>You may see my repo for <a href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/meghprkh/cakephp/" target="_blank" rel="external">copy and paste installation instructions</a></li>
